### Migrations

Migrations use go-migrate to handle migrations.

The up/down are stored in the migrations folder. If you alter the database you'll need to add an
update script there.

To migrate you database you'll need to run the following command.

```
migrate -path migrations/ -database "mysql://fooduser:foodtest@/food_test" up 2
```

_This command will migrate the test db that spins up in docker-compose.dev_
